The program generated random page request streams(length 15) for 10 processes and used both FIFO and Optimal Policy algorithms for each stream. 

Two seperate arrays of size 50 are used to simulate main memory; one for the FIFO algorithm and the other for the optimal replacement policy

Simulation can be changed by altering constants at the top of oss.cpp

Function Docs are provided above each function definition at the end of oss.cpp

For FIFO algorithm, a static counter variable is used to keep track of which frame in the buffer is to be replaced
